# waveform-generator
Generate Waveform using C programming alongside QNX software, PCI board and I/O devices such as oscilloscope 

This software program is designed to create various types of waveforms based on user inputs. The program offers the capability to generate sine, square, sawtooth, and triangular waves. By utilizing the keyboard, users have the option to modify parameters such as amplitude, average, frequency, duty cycle, and waveform type. For enhanced precision, amplitude and mean adjustments can also be executed through two potentiometers. Moreover, the software includes the ability to craft an arbitrary waveform via a potentiometer. This involves recording potentiometer values into a file and subsequently reading from it.

The program requires : 
1. QNX software
2. PCI board
3. Oscilloscope
4. Potentiometer
5. toggle switch
